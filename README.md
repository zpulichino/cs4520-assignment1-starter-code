Assignment 2 : Amazing Products

This is an andriod application which uses the navagation map, fragments, activities, and recycler view.
This application has a login page which if given the wrong username and password will show a toast message.
If given the correct information, the application will switch fragments and you should see all the products given in the dataset.
Each of the prodcuts is color coded based on the type of product it is. It also has an Image, Product Name, Price, and if applicable, an expiry date.

Using the ProductAdapter class I was able to adapt the products so they would be usable and placed in the correct place in the recycler view.
Using the product_item.xml file I was able to create each individual product section in the recycler view.

I don't believe there is anything additional needed to run this project. I had to change the SDK compiler from 33 to 34, but if you clone this repository then everything should be there.
